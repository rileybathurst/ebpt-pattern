# EBPT Pattern

``` % sass --watch source/css/style.scss source/css/style.css ```

## To DO

### Questions
Why are there three 

- _data/colors.json
- _patterns/00-atoms/01-tokens/00-brand-colors.json
- /css/scss/abstracts/_variables.scss

I kinda get that the scss has to be different but cant computers do this?

## Checks

Make sure everything seitches between className and class when back and forward from react
